### How to GIT 

This serves as an educational repository for students of the first semester of any computer science related studies. 

Currently this only holds the slides from the lecture held in WS2019.

If you find something interesting (e.g. a fancy git command, a bug, a useful thing to share) please feel free to open up an issue!
